Give a list of coefficients of a polynomial, return the integral of that polynomial
using C for any constant. Read in from the Input file and match
the Output file.

For example 3 2 1 corresponds to 3x^2 + 2x + 1 and the integral would be

x^3 + x^2 + x + C

Input Expressions can help visual some of the expressions in the input file.

Put parenthesis when there is a division in the integral ie the integral of
x^3 is (3/4)x^4 + C
